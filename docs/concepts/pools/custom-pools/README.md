# Custom AMMs

AMM’s built on top of the Balancer protocol leverage the security of the Balancer vault. This allows developers to tap into the well developed ecosystem of Balancer AMM’s while streamlining the development process through an optimized vault architecture that allows teams to focus on their product.
We help guide teams through the process using our years of experience of bringing innovative AMMs to market, including the finer details such as aggregator integration, which is a must have for any new AMM in order to properly capture the organic flow which is necessary for any modern AMM to compete.
Our goal is to facilitate the creation of novel AMMs with minimal friction by streamlining the development process.

When building a custom AMM on Balancer, there are two paths that can be taken:
- [Create a custom AMM with a novel invariant](/concepts/guides/create-custom-amm-with-novel-invariant.html)
- Extend an existing pool type using hooks
