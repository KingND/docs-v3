# Custom AMMs

Balancer protocol provides developers with a modular architecture that enables the rapid development of custom AMMs.

AMMs built on Balancer inherit the security of the Balancer vault, and benefit from a streamlined development process by allowing developer teams to leverage the well-established ecosystem of Balancer AMMs.
Balancer V3 was re-built from the ground up with developer experience as a core focus. Development teams can now focus on their product innovation without having to build an entire AMM from the ground up.

AMM’s built on top of the Balancer protocol leverage the security of the Balancer vault. This allows developers to tap into the well developed ecosystem of Balancer AMM’s while streamlining the development process through an optimized vault architecture that ensures teams focus on their product.
We help guide teams through the process using our years of experience of bringing innovative AMMs to market, including the finer details such as aggregator integration, which is a must have for any new AMM in order to properly capture the organic flow which is necessary for any modern AMM to compete.
Our goal is to facilitate the creation of novel AMMs with minimal friction by streamlining the development process.

Balancer V3 was re-built from the ground up with extensibility in mind.

AMMs built on Balancer inherit the security principles enshrined in the Balancer vault and streamline the development process while capitalizing on the well-established ecosystem of Balancer AMMs
Leveraging the well-established Balancer AMM ecosystem, our approach optimizes the development journey by implementing an advanced vault architecture that is tailor made to make building AMMs an easy process. This strategic framework allows development teams to concentrate entirely on perfecting their product without having to build an entire AMM from the ground up.
Benefiting from our extensive experience in launching innovative AMMs, we guide teams seamlessly through the entire process of bringing an AMM to market. This includes attention to intricate details such as aggregator integration, an essential element for any new AMM aspiring to capture organic flow and remain competitive in the modern landscape.
Our goal is to foster the creation of cutting-edge AMMs with minimal friction. By streamlining the development process and using the Balancer vault as a foundation, we aim to facilitate the emergence of novel and successful Automated Market Makers.
