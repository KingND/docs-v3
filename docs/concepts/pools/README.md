# Balancer Pools: Unmatched Design Flexibility

Balancer Pools are smart contracts that define how traders can swap between tokens on Balancer Protocol. What makes Balancer Pools unique from those of other protocols is their unparalleled flexibility. The architecture of Balancer Protocol empowers anyone to create their own custom pool types. With the introduction of [Hooks](./hooks.md) and [Dynamic Swap Fees](./dynamic-swap-fees.md) in V3, the realm of customization is boundless. Several custom pools have already been developed by external protocols like [Gyroscope](https://www.gyro.finance/) and [Xave](https://www.xave.co/). You can follow [this guide](../developer-guides/create-custom-amm-with-novel-invariant.md) to embark on creating your own custom pools.

Balancer has already developed, audited and deployed a variety of pool types showcasing diverse functionalities. These pools are readily accessible for existing use cases without requiring permission, and the accompanying code serves as a valuable resource for custom pool development. For more details see the [Exploring Available Balancer Pools](./exploring-available-balancer-pools/available-pools.md) section.
