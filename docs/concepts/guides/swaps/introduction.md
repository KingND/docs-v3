# Introduction

The following guides provide details and examples demonstrating how to execute swaps in two different ways:

1. [Router Interaction](./router-swaps.md): Interacting directly with the Balancer Router to execute Single and Multi Path Swaps.
2. [Smart Order Router & Swaps](./sor-router-swaps.md): Using the Balancer Smart Order Router (SOR), accessed via the Balancer API, to find optimal swap paths for a token pair. The SDK is then used to create and submit a swap transaction.
