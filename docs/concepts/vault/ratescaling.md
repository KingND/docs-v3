# Rate scaling

With the successful rollout of [The Merge](https://ethereum.org/roadmap/merge) and the adoption of [ERC-4626](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc4626), the ecosystem has seen a proliferation of yield bearing tokens. Recognizing the pivotal role that LSTs will play in the liquidity landscape moving forward, Balancer seeks to position itself as the definitive yield-bearing hub in DeFi.

To facilitate the adoption of yield bearing liquidity, Balancer abstracts the complexity of managing LSTs by centralizing all rate scaling in the vault, providing all pools with uniform rate scaled balances and input values by default, drastically reducing LVR and ensuring that YB yield is not captured by arbitrage traders.
