# Hosting of Liquid Staking and Restaking Tokens

:::info
Balancer is the most attuned decentralised financial technology layer to host yield-bearing assets. Yield-bearing tokens
such as LSTs and interest-bearing stablecoins offer an additional layer of efficiency compared to their vanilla
counterparts. These tokenised assets allow users to gain exposure to both onchain and offchain interest rates,
compounded within a single token. This notion page serves as an information hub that explains why, it details
Balancer’s unique YB PMFs, and also links to case studies and additional resources for partner integrations.

This is achieved by utilizing three core components:
1. Rate provider technology
